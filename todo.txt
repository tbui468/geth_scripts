Note: Mining can be used for private networks, but mainnet
    requires a consensus client since ethereum switch to proof-of-stake
    Geth and a consensus client (such as Prysm, a Go POS implementation) and maintain ethereum blockchain
    Back in the day only an execution client was necessary, but the switch now requires a different consensus mechanism
    Consider running Prysm alongside Geth for the private network

***********************Structured Courses********************************
CryptoZombies
Ethernauts

**************************Test Contracts*******************************
Test encoding of multiple strings (dynamic) and static arguments

Does this work with bytes32?  Or is the encoding format different?

Write code to decode strings from blockchain

Encode array arguments

Decode array returns (????)

Interact with more complex contract
    Ballot Contract - write python tests for Ballot functionality

***********************KickStarter System****************************
Send money to account
if amount reach, project is funded
else if time limit reached without full funding, sent money is refunded
Would still need a third-party to settle disputes (eg, project spent all money without delivering promise)

******************Interact with Ballot Contract using Metamask**********
May need to set up basic javascript frontend for this

******************Use eth_utils to manually sign transactions***********
Bypass the geth accounts stuff, and understand what metamask is doing behind the scenes
    probably a good idea to undestand (at least understand usage) of one of the cryptographic primitives

    digital signatures in ethereum - does it use ECDSA?

******************Set up private proof-of-stake network******************
Use Geth and Prysm
