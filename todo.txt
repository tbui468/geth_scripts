Note: Mining can be used for private networks, but mainnet
    requires a consensus client since ethereum switch to proof-of-stake
    Geth and a consensus client (such as Prysm, a Go POS implementation) and maintain ethereum blockchain

    Consider running Prysm alongside Geth for the private network

Interact with more complex contract
    methods with parameters
    methods that change blockchain state
    Ballot Contract
