Note: Mining can be used for private networks, but mainnet
    requires a consensus client since ethereum switch to proof-of-stake
    Geth and a consensus client (such as Prysm, a Go POS implementation) and maintain ethereum blockchain
    Back in the day only an execution client was necessary, but the switch now requires a different consensus mechanism
    Consider running Prysm alongside Geth for the private network

******************Test json-rpc******************************************
Remove miner1 node - not really necessary
Make both node1 and node2 miners (just set threads for mining)
Make node1 account locked and set json-rpc server to use http to allow testing with MetaMask
Make node2 account unlocked and set json-rpc server to ipc (default already) to deploy contracts

Deploy contracts with node 2
Test with node 2 with IPC
Test with node 1 using metamask (manual testing...?  Or could we automate this too?)

******************Compile and run contract on private miner network*********
******************Interact with smart contracts using Metamask**********
******************Set up private proof-of-stake network******************
Use Geth and Prysm
