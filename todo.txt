Note: Mining can be used for private networks, but mainnet
    requires a consensus client since ethereum switch to proof-of-stake
    Geth and a consensus client (such as Prysm, a Go POS implementation) and maintain ethereum blockchain
    Back in the day only an execution client was necessary, but the switch now requires a different consensus mechanism
    Consider running Prysm alongside Geth for the private network

**********************Foundations*****************************
Finish reading Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency technologies
Watch video on building a mini-cryptocurrency in Ruby
Without referring to video, build a mini-cryptocurrency in Python
    try using hash functions/dsa from eth_utils so that we can skip the geth signers

***********************Proof-of-Stake*********************************
Make a new Prysm project
Make a geth executaion node
Make a prysm beacon node
Make a validator

**************************Ballot Contract*******************************
Read this for a run-down on async/await with python
    https://realpython.com/async-io-python/
async await for certain function calls
    giving all accounts voting rights can all be done asynchronously
    voting of all users can be done asynchronously
    network startup and shutdown can probably also be called using await/async
        this would simplify our testing loop significantly - running a single
        script will start the network, run the tests and then shutdown the network

Only need to be asynchronous when redeeming transaction rececipts to get events emitted
    all other calls should return immediately (but could make them asynchronous too)

Make more signers - 2 miners and 8 non-mining nodes

Time to end vote and reveal results - should be set in constructor
    If there's a tie between 2 or more proposals, then owner can cast a vote
    Only allow owner vote if there's a tie at the end, and the vote must be on one of the tied proposals
Voters can delegate vote to another account (that must also have voting rights already)
    event for when delegation is successful
Check for other features in Ballot contract
Test theirs and test mine

Interact with more complex contract
    Ballot Contract - write python tests for Ballot functionality

***********************Ideas****************************
KickStarter DAO
    Send money to account
    if amount reach, project is funded
    else if time limit reached without full funding, sent money is refunded
    Would still need a third-party to settle disputes (eg, project spent all money without delivering promise)

Staking-as-a-Service DAO
    Stakers send ether to stake pool described by smart contract
    Owner of server running consensus client takes a small cut of profits, remaining sent to stakers

Uniswap Defi
    Implement uniswap paper(s)

******************Interact with Ballot Contract using Metamask**********
May need to set up basic javascript frontend for this

******************Use eth_utils to manually sign transactions***********
Bypass the geth accounts stuff, and understand what metamask is doing behind the scenes
    probably a good idea to undestand (at least understand usage) of one of the cryptographic primitives

    digital signatures in ethereum - does it use ECDSA?

******************Set up private proof-of-stake network******************
Use Geth and Prysm
