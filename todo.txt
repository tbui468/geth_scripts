Note: Mining can be used for private networks, but mainnet
    requires a consensus client since ethereum switch to proof-of-stake
    Geth and a consensus client (such as Prysm, a Go POS implementation) and maintain ethereum blockchain
    Back in the day only an execution client was necessary, but the switch now requires a different consensus mechanism
    Consider running Prysm alongside Geth for the private network

**************************Test Contracts*******************************
Interact with more complex contract
    methods that change blockchain state - need to send transaction
        can call be used to change blockchain state?
    Ballot Contract - write python tests for Ballot functionality

**************Decode string return value from contract method call*********************
hex -> string

******************Interact with Ballot Contract using Metamask**********
May need to set up basic javascript frontend for this

******************Use eth_utils to manually sign transactions***********
Bypass the geth accounts stuff, and understand what metamask is doing behind the scenes
    probably a good idea to undestand (at least understand usage) of one of the cryptographic primitives

    digital signatures in ethereum - does it use ECDSA?

******************Set up private proof-of-stake network******************
Use Geth and Prysm
